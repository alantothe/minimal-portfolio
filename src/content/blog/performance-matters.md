# Performance Matters

In today's internet landscape, performance is no longer a nice-to-have—it's a fundamental requirement. Users expect instant feedback, and every millisecond counts. Performance directly impacts user satisfaction, SEO rankings, and conversion rates.

## The Cost of Slowness

Studies consistently show that:

- **53%** of mobile users abandon sites that take longer than 3 seconds to load
- Every **100ms** delay in load time can reduce conversions by **1%**
- Performance affects **SEO rankings** across search engines
- Slow sites lead to **increased bounce rates** and lower engagement

## Performance Across Layers

### Frontend Optimization
- Minimize JavaScript and CSS
- Lazy load images and non-critical content
- Use browser caching effectively
- Optimize assets before serving

### Backend Optimization
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Use efficient algorithms
- Minimize database queries
- Implement proper indexing

### Network Optimization
- Use CDNs for static assets
- Enable compression (gzip, brotli)
- Reduce payload sizes
- Implement HTTP/2

## Practical Metrics

Track these key performance indicators:

- **First Contentful Paint (FCP):** When first content appears
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP):** When main content is visible
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS):** Visual stability metric
- **Time to Interactive (TTI):** When page becomes interactive

## Building for Speed

The best practice is to prioritize performance from the ground up:

1. **Start lean:** Use minimal dependencies
2. **Measure regularly:** Use tools like Lighthouse and WebPageTest
3. **Optimize continuously:** Performance is an ongoing process
4. **Think about constraints:** Build for slower networks and devices

Performance isn't about achieving perfect scores—it's about creating experiences that feel responsive and satisfying to users. Every optimization counts.
